 * The idea here is that this class bridges one or more menus with a [IEngineConnection] to perform a specific
 * task whenever a new selectable is adder or removed and whenever the any item on a menu is clicked.
 *
 *
 * The class that is responsible for the performer menu should also provide the [IPerformerEngine]
 * to which this will add callbacks and listeners.
 *
 *
 * Because [Selectable] is referred to as the base class, the [Callback] methods shouldn't be used to
 * identify the derivatives. Instead, you should use the engine connection to identify the objects.
